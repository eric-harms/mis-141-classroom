				The conversation is getting old. You know, the one about how Apple isn’t innovating with new hardware because the future of its business is in services and streaming video and this new Apple credit card that blah blah blah. But a lot of people point out one exception, one new Apple product that feels truly revolutionary and very good: AirPods. The second generation AirPods have arrived, and I can confidently say that they are very good. As an upgrade, I guess they’re fine. They’re not revolutionary, and that’s okay.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				Let me be clear: I don’t have many bad things to say about the second generation AirPods. Most of the good things I have to say about them are also true for the first generation AirPods, which first shipped in December 2016.
			</p>

				To the naked eye, the new AirPods are identical to the original ones, except they’re functionally better than the first generation AirPods, thanks to a new Apple-made H1 wireless chip. You also have the option to buy a wireless charging case which simply enables you to charge the case and AirPods wirelessly. The second generation AirPods cost $160 with a regular case and $200 with a wireless charging case. (The wireless charging case can also be purchased separately for $80 and works with both generations of AirPods.) You can currently buy brand new first generation AirPods on Amazon for a little less than $150.
